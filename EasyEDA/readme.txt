If for some reason you couldn't import into your own EasyEDA, you can try using online format viewer websites to view. If you need to edit the versions, you would have to manually c&p and make a copy of it in your EasyEDA yourself.

The version of PCB sent for manufacturing is in the NIR_v4-BuckPuck/BigDesign-9x9. In the same folder NIR_V4-BuckPuck contains another version of a PCB design where modules are mounted on both side to save space. Dimension of it is 7x7cm, height is BuckPuck + 2.5AVoltage Regulator + 0.5cm(pcb thickness) stacked. If in the future a more compact version of PCB is needed you can take reference to this version of PCB if you wish.
